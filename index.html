                <p>Being a digital native lends itself to a completely different experience from that of a digital immigrant. What does
                that statement mean? It means that an individual who comes of age using a smart phone and interacting with
                social media has relationships with those entities that significantly intense and consuming. For those who
                grew up before the digital age and have merely encorporated these devices and applications into an already 
                established life workflow, the effect is less significant.

                <h5>Dating and Relationships</h5>
                <p>Who hasn't heard the term Hookup Culture? The question really is who knows what it means? It is a set of rules
                and expectations that currently shape the relationships, both romantic and otherwise, of most young adults. Hookup is 
                purposefully vague term that refers to a kiss and everything beyond. A full understanding of Hookup Culture requires a 
                commitment of time and emotional vulnerability. Let's just consider some of the implications of a social script that
                dictates casual sexual encounters and prohibits the development of intimacy.

                        <blockquote>Hookup culture is not the same as having freedom to explore sexuality. This is a social construction
                            based on using other people for personal satisfaction and social status. These are selfish pursuits without any real consideration 
                            for the dignity of others. Additionally, since many participants educate themselves by watching pornography, the 
                            accepted norm for sexual interaction is skewed in a violent way. When alcohol becomes part of this equation, it
                            can have devastating consequences.

                        all relationsihps. Students report wide-spread feelings of loneliness and isolation as a consequence of Hookup
                        Culture. Even individuals who opt out are left with a sense of being on their own island that no one will ever visit.
