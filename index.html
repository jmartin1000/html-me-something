        <h1>The Suffering of Young and Emerging Adults</h1>
        <p>It's undeniable. Even if the media weren't replete with stories, we cannot avoid this reality. It is
        everywhere we look... in our schools, in our neighborhoods and in our own lives. Anxiety, Depression
        and Suicide are words that are too commonly associated with teens and young adults. What is happening?
        Are we creating weaker generations or is it something else? </p>
        <br>
        <h2>On being 18 in 2018</h2>
        <p>Taking an honest assessment of the pressures that assail young adults is helpful. While life has its
        way of wearing us down, assuming that the high school graduate of today is facing the same pressures as 
        he did 30 years ago is a bold assumption, and possibly a naive one. Let's do some exploring.

            <p>Univerisity professionals report
            that the students arriving on their campuses today are significantly less mature than even 10 years ago. Why wouldn't they be?
            The demands put on them will supercede some of the less obvious actions that lead to maturity: making mistakes, personal reflection,
            and habits of self care and support. So, the students, who
            are not stupid, know that in some very significant way, they are not ready for this transistion, a realization that simply
            intensifies the pressure to not fail.

            <h3>Social Media</h3>
            <p>Being a digital native lends itself to a completely different experience from that of a digital immigrant. What does
            that statement mean? It means that an individual who comes of age using a smart phone and interacting with
            social media has relationships with those entities that significantly intense and consuming. For those who
            grew up before the digital age and have merely encorporated these devices and applications into an already 
            established life workflow, the effect is less significant.

        <p>We are sacrificing our youth on the altar of profit and greed. Consider the industries that boost the demand for
        their product by targeting teens and even pre-teens:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Colleges and Universities</li>
            <li>Testing Agencies and Test Prep businesses</li>
            <li>Social Media</li>
            <li>Pornography</li>
            <li>Alcohol</li>
            <li>Marijuana</li>
            <li>Clothes brands</li>
            <li>Plenty more could go here...</li>
        </ul>
        <p>They have taken their cue from the tabacco industry, employing an effective strategy of pursuing a naive and defenseless audience. 
        While companies and stock holders get rich, our youth are withering and even dying.
